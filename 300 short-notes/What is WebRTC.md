- WebRTC is an open *framework for the web* that enables **Real Time Communications in the browser**. 
- Initially for connecting the clients there is a need of a server (*signalling server*), once connected there is no need of servers to transfer data, *data is transferred using peer to peer connection*.
- Signalling server allows the two parties to safely exchange connection data but never touches the data that is transferred between the peers.
- It includes the fundamental building blocks for high-quality communications on the web, such as network, audio and video components used in voice and video chat applications.
- The main difference between Skype and WebRTC is that there is no need to install any software.
- These components, when implemented in a browser, can be accessed through JavaScript APIs, enabling developers to easily implement their own RTC web app.

- SDP, ICE, Stun servers, difficult since there our devices our behind NAT firewalls.
- We have free stun servers from google.
