## Searching
- If you want to **search for two words then use quotes**.
	- For example `abc def` will search for occurrences of `abc` or `def`
	- `"abc def"` will search for `abc def`
	- If you searching for words which contain quotes then use backslash.
- **Search in a specific folder or subfolder**:
	- Lets suppose I want to search for something only in the Python folder (indexed as 108)
	- I can do this using `path:108 search_term` or `path:python search_term`.
	- Here `path` means path should contain.
	- The way I have structured my notes, using index number is a great way of filtering through the notes.
