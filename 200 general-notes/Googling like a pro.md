## Tips on googling
- Google works on the page rank algorithm.
- There are signals which determine the quality of a website.
	- Page rank is one of the signals.
- Every word is useful in the search.

> [!note]- *Spelling, punctuation and capitalisation doesn't matter*.

- **Construct more general queries to avoid any biases**:
	- *For example instead of search "is javascript the best programming language" search "what is the most popular programming language"*.

### Search operators
- Using **double quotes** (`""`) around any term will force google to match it **exactly**. 
- Exclusion using `-`: 
	- Example: `website tutorial -jquery`, we won't get any results consisting of jquery.
- Wildcard `*`:
	- Useful when *debugging since the error messages* that **we get might contain directories that are only relevant to us so instead of pasting the whole block of text we can replace it with `*` to significantly improve the results**.
- Date operators:
	- `avatar review before:2010`: will return results before 2010.
	- `some error message after:2021-01-01`: will return results after 2021.
	- An use case would be `python courses after:2021` so that you only get the latest courses.
	- If we use *both before and after then we can filter between dates*.
- Getting results from a particular website:
	- `grpc site:reddit.com`
		- **It is important to have the full domain name just reddit wouldn't work**.
- Searching for a specific filetype:
	- `grpc filetype:pdf`
	- Similarly we can find `txt, epub, png, csv` etc.

> [!tip]- If a website is down you can still see it using `cache:sarthaknarayan.tech`
