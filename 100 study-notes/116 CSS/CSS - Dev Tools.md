## Dev Tools
- Grid & Flex box editor
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230325110822.png]]
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230325110924.png]]
- We can change the colour in the browser in the styles tab.
- Going to the computed tab we can see the styles that are being applied to the element and see where they are coming from.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230325132557.png]]
	- This method can be easier to find which code is applying the style rather than searching in the styles tab.

> [!note] For box model visualization **padding: green**, **border: yellow** and **margin: orange**.

- We can adjust values directly in the box model.
- We can toggle the hover state of an element
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230325133044.png]]
	- We can also toggle other states
- Finding out particular media queries a site is using
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230325133311.png]]
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230325133348.png]]
- If we want to apply a style to the selected element we do it in `element.style` in the styles tab.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230325133756.png]]
- But if we want to create a new style altogether like having a different colour for all the paragraph elements then we can use the + symbol.
- Firefox is great for debugging CSS it can *tell you why some style is not working*
