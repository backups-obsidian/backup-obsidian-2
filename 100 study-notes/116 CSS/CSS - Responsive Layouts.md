## Responsive Layouts
- Avoid fixed sizes like `width: 600px`.
	- If you want to set fixed sizes then use properties like `max-width: 600px`. 
	- This means we cannot go greater than 600px.
- Don't set heights.
	- If you want to set heights use properties like `min-height: 300px` to prevent overflow of content.
