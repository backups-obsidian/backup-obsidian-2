	- **Block level elements will always stack vertically** even if they can fit next to each other.

[[CSS - Position]]


- Different ways of hiding the element:
	- `display: none;`: 
		- Removes it from the document.
		- It affects the placement of other elements.
	- `visibility: hidden;`: 
		- Simply makes it invisible.
		- It *DOES NOT affect the placement of other elements*.
