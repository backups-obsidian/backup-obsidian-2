## Question Areas
- EC2 - Instance purchasing options
- Elastic Load Balancer - For extent check in video
- NACLs and SGs
- IAM
- Scaling policies
- Health checks load balancers and ASG

## Extra Notes
- Elastic Load balancer *cannot balance between regions*.
- The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets.
- Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs.

- Difference between ACM and IAM for certificates.
	- *AWS Certificate Manager* (ACM) is the *preferred tool* to provision, manage, and deploy server certificates.
	-Â In a **supported Region**, you can use ACM to manage server certificates from the console or programmatically.
	 - *IAM is used as a certificate manager* only when you must support HTTPS connections in a **Region that is not supported by ACM**.
	 - *IAM* supports deploying server certificates in all Regions, but you must *obtain your certificate from an external provider* for use with AWS. You cannot upload an ACM certificate to IAM.
- Amazon recommends *using Target Tracking Scaling policies*.
- By *default*, **IAM users do not have access to the AWS Billing and Cost Management console**. 
	- You can grant users access by **activating IAM user access** to the Billing and Cost Management console and **attaching** an IAM policy to your users.

- **AWS Budgets** lets customers set custom budgets and receive alerts if their costs or usage exceed (or are *forecasted* to exceed) their budgeted amount.
	- **AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts**.
	- If you set a budget to alert based on a forecasted amount, this *budget alert isn't triggered until you have enough historical usage information*.

- **Permissions boundary** and **AWS Organisation Service Control Policy (SCP)** *only limits permissions* but cannot grant permissions. 
	- Permission boundary defines the max permission that can be given to a user.
	- SCPs define the maximum permissions for account members of an organisation or organisational unit (OU).
