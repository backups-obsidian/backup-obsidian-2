- The mean reason for using API Gateway over ALB for invoking Lambda's from HTTP endpoints are the features (like caching and all) offered by the API Gateway.

## Deployment Stages
- Making changes in the API Gateway does not mean they're effective. You need to make a *deployment for them to be in effect*.
- **Changes are deployed to Stages** (as many as you want)
	- Use the naming you like for stages (dev, test, prod)
	- Each *stage has its own configuration parameters*
	- *Stages can be rolled back* as a history of deployments is kept
- We can have *multiple stages* deployed together. 
	- A common use case is to have 2 stages v1 and v2 to *maintain compatibility*. 
	- We can migrate the clients from v1 to v2 gradually and when no more clients are using v1 we can shut it down.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220526151955.png]]
- Each stage has its own settings
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220526153838.png]]

### Stage Variables
- Stage variables are like **environment variables for API Gateway**
- Use them to change *often changing configuration values*
- They can be used in:
	- *Lambda function ARN*
	- *HTTP Endpoint*
	- Parameter mapping templates
- Use cases:
	- Configure HTTP endpoints your stages talk to (dev, test, prod...)
	- Pass configuration parameters to AWS Lambda through mapping templates
- Stage variables are passed to the **context object in AWS Lambda**

#### Stage Variables & Aliases
- We create a *stage variable to indicate the corresponding Lambda alias*
- Our API gateway will automatically invoke the right Lambda function!

## Canary Deployments
- Possibility to enable canary deployments **for any stage (usually prod)**
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220526154203.png]]
- Choose the *% of traffic* the canary channel receives 
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220526154031.png]]
- Metrics & Logs are separate (for better monitoring)
- Possibility to override stage variables for canary
- This is **blue/green deployment** with AWS Lambda & API Gateway

## Swagger / Open API spec
- We can *import existing* Swagger / OpenAPI 3.0 spec to API Gateway
- We can also *export current API* as Swagger / OpenAPI spec
- *JSON or YAML file*
- Once imported API will be created from the JSON/YAML document.

## Usage Plans & API Keys
- If you want to *make an API available as an offering ($) to your customers*
- **Usage Plan**:
	- *Who can access* one or more deployed API stages and methods
	- *How much and how fast* they can access them
	- Uses *API keys to identify API clients and meter access*
	- *Configure throttling limits and quota* limits that are enforced on individual client
- **API Keys**:
	- Alphanumeric string values to distribute to your customers
	- Can use with *usage plans to control access*
	- **Throttling limits are applied to the API keys**
	- Quotas limits is the overall number of maximum requests
- **Configuring a usage plan**: 
	- Create one or more APIs, *configure the methods to require an API key*, and deploy the APIs to stages.
	- *Generate or import API keys* to distribute to application developers (your customers) who will be using your API.
	- *Create the usage plan* with the desired throttle and quota limits.
	- *Associate API stages and API keys with the usage plan*.

> [!tip] Usage plan order: Create API -> Create Key -> Create Usage Plan -> Associate Usage Plan

> [!note] Callers of the API must supply an assigned API key In the `x-api-key` header in requests to the API

## HTTP API vs REST API
- HTTP APIs
	- **low-latency**, **cost-effective** AWS Lambda proxy, HTTP proxy APIs and private integration (no data mapping). **Only proxies**.
	- Support *OIDC* and *OAuth 2.0*
	- Authorisation, and built-in support for CORS 
	- No usage plans and API keys
- REST APIs
	- All features (**except Native OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0**)

> [!note]- For exam perspective just remember 
> - HTTP API is a *low cost alternative* 
> - It *only supports proxy integrations* 
> - There is no such thing as usage plan and API keys.

## CORS
- CORS must be **enabled when you receive API calls from another domain**.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527091836.png]]
- The *OPTIONS pre-flight* request must contain the following headers:
	- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
	- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
	- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
- CORS can be enabled through the console
- If you using a *lambda proxy or a HTTP proxy* you will need to have `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in your backend code since it is the one responding when there is a preflights request.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527092332.png]]

> [!tip]- CORS is used to restrict access to your APIs from other domains
> You team maintains a public API Gateway that is *accessed by clients from another domain*. Usage has been consistent for the last few months but recently it has more than doubled. As a result, your costs have gone up and would like to prevent other unauthorised domains from accessing your API. 
> Restrict access using CORS.

## WebSocket API
- It enables *stateful application* use cases.
- WebSocket APIs are often used in **real time applications** such as chat applications, collaboration platforms, multiplayer games, and financial trading platforms.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527094642.png]]

- *Connecting to the API*
	- ConnectionId is stored in DynamoDB along with meta data 
	- When the client disconnects ConnectionId will be deleted from DynamoDB
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527094727.png]]
- *Client to Server Messaging*
	- User information and other meta data is retrieved from DynamoDB using the ConnectionId
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527094922.png]]
- *Server to Client Messaging*
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527094958.png]]

### Routing 
- Incoming JSON messages are **routed to different backend**
- If no routes => sent to `$default`
- You request a **route selection expression** to select the field on JSON to route from
	- See the routing expression
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527095410.png]]

> [!note] For exam perspective remember routing is there to *route to a specific backend* based on the routing expression

## Architecture Example
- Create a **single interface for all the microservices** in your company
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220527100357.png]]
- Use API endpoints with various resources
- Apply a simple domain name and SSL certificates
- Can apply forwarding and transformation rules at the API Gateway level
