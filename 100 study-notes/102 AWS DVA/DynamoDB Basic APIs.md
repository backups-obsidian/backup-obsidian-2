## Writing Data
- `PutItem`
	- Creates a **new item** or **fully replace an old item** (*same Primary Key*)
	- *Consumes WCUs*

- `UpdateItem`
	- *Edits an existing item's attributes* or *adds a new item if it doesn't exist*
	- Can be used to implement **Atomic Counters** a numeric attribute that's unconditionally incremented
	
- `ConditionalWrites`
	- Accept a write/update/delete only if conditions are met, otherwise returns an error
	- Helps with **concurrent access** to items

## Reading Data
- `GetItem`
	- Read **based on Primary key**
	- Primary Key can be HASH or HASH+RANGE
	- *Eventually Consistent Read (default)*
	- Option to use *Strongly Consistent Reads* (*more RCU*, *might take longer*)
	- `ProjectionExpression` can be specified to **retrieve only certain attributes**
		- A projection expression is *a string that identifies the attributes you want*. 
		- To retrieve a single attribute, specify its name. 
		- For multiple attributes, the names must be comma-separated.

### Query
- Query returns items based on:
	- **KeyConditionExpression**: (`--query`)
		- *Partition Key value* (must be `=` operator): **required**
		- *Sort Key value* (=, <, <=, >, >=, Between, Begins with): **Optionally**, you can provide a sort key attribute and use a comparison operator to *refine the search results*.
	- **FilterExpression**
		- Additional filtering *after the Query operation* (before data returned to you)
		- Use *only with non-key attributes* (does not allow HASH or RANGE attributes)
- *Returns*:
	- The number of items specified in **Limit**
	- Or up to **1MB of data**
- To get more data we need to use pagination.
- Can *query table*, a *Local Secondary Index*, or *Global Secondary Index*.

### Scan
> [!note]- `GetItem` was *for one item*, *query was for specific partition key* and *scan is to read out an entire table* and then filter our data. It is **inefficient**.
> Filtering has to be done on the client side

- Returns up to 1 MB of data use pagination to keep on reading
- *Consumes a lot of RCU*
- Limit impact using **Limit** or reduce the size of the result and pause
- For *faster performance*, use **Parallel Scan**
	- *Multiple workers* scan multiple data segments at the same time
	- Increases the throughput and RCU consumed
	- Limit the impact of parallel scans just like you would for Scans
- Can use *ProjectionExpression* & *FilterExpression* (no changes to RCU)

## Deleting Data
- `DeleteItem`
	- Delete an **individual item**
	- Ability to perform a conditional delete
- `DeleteTable`
	- Delete a *whole table and all its items*
	- **Much quicker deletion** than calling `DeleteItem` on all items

## Batch Operations
- Allows you to **save in latency** by *reducing the number of API calls*
- Operations are done in **parallel** for better efficiency
- Part of a batch can fail; in which case we need to try again for the failed items
- `BatchWriteItem`
	- Up to **25** `PutItem` and/or `DeleteItem` in one call
	- Up to **16 MB** of data written, up to 400 KB of data per item
	- **Can't update items** (use `UpdateItem`)
- `BatchGetItem`
	- Return *items from one or more tables*
	- Up to *100 items*, up to **16 MB** of data
	- Items are retrieved in *parallel to minimise latency*
