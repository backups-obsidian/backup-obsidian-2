## Sampling
- With sampling rules, you **control the amount of data that you record**
- You can *modify sampling rules without changing your code*
- By *default*, the X-Ray SDK records the **first request each second**, and **five percent of any additional requests**.
	- *One request per second* is the **reservoir**, which ensures that *at least one trace is recorded* each second as long the service is serving requests.
	- *Five percent* is the **rate** at which *additional requests beyond the reservoir size are sampled*.
	-  For example, if you set the *reservoir size to 50* and *fixed rate to 10%*, then if *100 requests per second* match the rule, the *total sampled is 55 requests per second*.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220519155053.png]]
	- *Rate of 1 means all requests* should be sent to X-Ray. This is only good for debugging and will be very expensive in production.

- You can *create your own rules* with the reservoir and rate
- We can define many sampling rules with *different priority*. **Lower priority** takes *precedence*.
- We can also specify the **matching criteria** which determines *what requests to match*.

> [!note] You can very quickly change the sampling rules from the X-Ray console and there is *no need of restarting the application*. Daemon knows how to fetch the new sampling rules.

## X-Ray APIs
### X-Ray Write APIs 
- Used by the **X-Ray daemon**
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220519155927.png]]
- **PutTraceSegments**: *Uploads segment* documents to AWS X-Ray
- **PutTelemetryRecords**: Used by the AWS X-Ray daemon to *upload telemetry*.
	- SegmentsReceivedCount, SegmentsRejectedCounts, *BackendConnectionErrors*
- **GetSamplingRules**: *Retrieve all sampling rules* (to know what/when to send)
- **GetSamplingTargets** & **GetSamplingStatisticSummaries**: advanced
- The *X-Ray daemon needs to have an IAM policy* authorising the correct API calls to function correctly

### X-Ray Read APIs
- **GetServiceGraph**: *main graph*
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220519160333.png]]
- **BatchGetTraces**: Retrieves a *list of traces specified by ID*. Each trace is a collection of segment documents that originates from a single request.
- **GetTraceSummaries**: Retrieves *IDs and annotations for traces* available for a specified time frame using an optional filter. *To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to BatchGet Traces*.
- **GetTraceGraph**: Retrieves a *service graph for one or more specific trace IDs*.

## X-Ray with BeanStalk
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk platforms **include the X-Ray daemon**
- You can run the daemon by setting an option in the Elastic Beanstalk *console* or with a *configuration file* (in `.ebextensions/xray-daemon.config`)
- Make sure to give your *instance profile the correct lAM permissions* so that the X-Ray daemon can function correctly
- Then make sure your *application code is instrumented with the X-Ray SDK*

## X-Ray with ECS
> [!important]- Things to be done for using the *Side Car pattern*.
> - *Port mapping*: container port *2000* and the protocol **UDP**
> - *Environment Variable*: So that X-Ray SDK can find the X-Ray daemon.
> - *Link the containers* from the network standpoint.

> Because of linking the containers value of `xray-daemon` can be resolved.

### ECS Cluster with EC2
- X-Ray **Container as a Daemon**
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220519161055.png]]
- X-Ray **Container as a Side Car**. Also known as *multi container* setup.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220519161102.png]]

### ECS Cluster with Fargate
- Since we don't have control over the underlying instances we **can only use the Side Car pattern**.
