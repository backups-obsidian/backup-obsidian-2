## Integration Types
- Integration Type **MOCK**
	- API Gateway *returns a response without sending the request to the backend*
	- Just for *development and testing*

- Integration Type **HTTP/AWS (Lambda & AWS Services)**
	- We must configure both the *integration request* and *integration response*
	- We can setup data mapping using **mapping templates** to modify the request & response.
		- This means we will be able to change the request made to the backed and change the response received from the backend before sending it to the client.
		- Example: mapping the REST API to an API call on SQS Queue *so that SQS queue can understand the API call made by the API Gateway*.

- Integration Type **AWS_PROXY (Lambda Proxy)**
	- Incoming request from the client is the input to Lambda
	- The **function is responsible for the logic of request/response**. 
	- *All the work is done on the backend* and API Gateway is there just to proxy the request.
	- *No mapping template*, headers, query string parameters, etc are *passed as arguments*

- Integration Type **HTTP_PROXY**
	- *No mapping template*
	- The HTTP request is passed to the backend
	- The HTTP response from the backend is forwarded by API Gateway
	- API Gateway is used just to proxy the request

## Mapping Templates
- So *mapping templates* can only be used if we use HTTP/AWS services **without proxy**.
- Mapping templates can be *used to modify request/responses*
- Type of modification that can be done:
	- *Rename/Modify query string parameters*
	- Modify body content
	- *Add headers*
- Uses **Velocity Template Language (VTL)**: it a scripting language for writing these templates.
- *Filter output results* (remove unnecessary data)

> [!tip]- In general it is *better to use proxy integration types* (either lambda or HTTP)
> Otherwise you have to learn another scripting language just to modify the request and responses.

### Use cases: JSON to XML with SOAP
- SOAP API are XML based, whereas REST API are JSON based
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220526160129.png]]
- In this case, API Gateway should:
	- Extract data from the request: either path, payload or header
	- *Build SOAP message based on request data* (**mapping template**)
	- Call SOAP service and receive XML response
	- *Transform XML response to desired format* (like JSON), and respond to the user

### Use cases: Renaming Variables
