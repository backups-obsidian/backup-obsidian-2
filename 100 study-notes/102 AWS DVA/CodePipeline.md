- *Visual Workflow* to **orchestrate your CICD**
- **Sources**:
	- *CodeCommit* 
	- *ECR* 
	- *S3*
	- *GitHub*

- *Build*: *CodeBuild*, Jenkins, CloudBees, TeamCity
- *Test*: *CodeBuild*, AWS Device Farm, 3rd party tools
- *Deploy*: *CodeDeploy*, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, ECS, S3,

- **Consists of stages**:
	- Each stage can have **multiple sequential actions and/or parallel actions**
	- Example stages: Build (CodeBuild)  → Test (CodeBuild) → Deploy (CodeDeploy) → Load → Testing
- **Manual approval** can be defined at any stage
- If any of the stages fail before deploying the code then it won't deploy the code. Like if some tests fail in CodeBuild.

## Artifacts
- **Each pipeline stage can create artifacts**
- Artifacts stored in an **S3 bucket** and *passed on to the next stage*

## Troubleshooting
- For CodePipeline Pipeline/Action/Stage *Execution State Changes* we can use **CloudWatch Events** (Amazon EventBridge). Example:
	- You can create events for *failed pipelines*
	- You can create events for *cancelled stages*
- If CodePipeline fails a stage, your pipeline stops, and you can *get information in the console*
- If pipeline *can't perform an action*, make sure the *IAM Service Role* attached does have *enough lAM permissions* (IAM Policy)
- *AWS CloudTrail* can be used to *audit AWS API calls*

> [!caution] You **can't use SNS** for getting notifications on failures.
