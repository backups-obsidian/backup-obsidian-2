## AppConfig
- Configure, validate, and **deploy dynamic configurations**
- Deploy dynamic configuration changes to your applications independently of any code deployments
	- You *DON'T need to restart the application*
- **Feature flags**, application tuning, allow/block listing, etc.
- Use with *apps on EC2 instances, Lambda, ECS, EKS*.
- Gradually deploy the configuration changes and rollback if issues occur.
