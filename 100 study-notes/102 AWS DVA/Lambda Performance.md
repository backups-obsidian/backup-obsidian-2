## Performance
- **RAM**:
	- From **128MB to 10GB** in 1 MB increments
	- The more RAM you add, the more CPU credits you get
	- At *1,792 MB*, a function has the equivalent of *one full vCPU*
	- *After 1,792 MB*, you get *more than one CPU*, and need to use *multi-threading in your code to benefit from it*.

> [!tip] If your application is CPU-bound (computation heavy), increase RAM

- **Timeout**: 
	- *default 3 seconds* 
	- *maximum* is 900 seconds (**15 minutes**)

## Execution Context
- The execution context is a **temporary runtime environment** that *initialises any external dependencies of your lambda code*
- Great for database connections, HTTP clients, SDK clients, etc.
- The *execution context is maintained for some time* in anticipation of another Lambda function invocation
- The next function invocation can **re-use** the *context to execution time and save time in initialising connections objects*.
- The execution context includes the `/tmp` directory which can be *shared across invocations*.
	- If your Lambda function needs to *download a big file to work*
	- If your Lambda function needs *disk space to perform operations*
	- Max size is **512MB**
	- The *directory content remains when the execution context is frozen*, providing **transient cache** that can be used for multiple invocations (helpful to *checkpoint your work*)
	- For *permanent persistence* of object (non temporary), *use S3*

> [!important]- Execution context is *part of the code outside the function handler*
> - Try to initialise DB connections or *anything that takes time* outside the connection handler so that they can be reused across invocations.
> - This will **greatly improve function performance**

## Concurrency
- **Concurrency limit**: up to *1000* concurrent executions **for all the functions** in the per region.
- We can set our own *limit* to the number of concurrent executions known as **reserved concurrency** at the function level.
	- Each *invocation over the concurrency limit will trigger a Throttle*
- Throttle behaviour:
	- If **synchronous invocation** => return *ThrottleError 429*
	- If **asynchronous invocation** => *retry automatically and then go to DLQ*
- If you need a *higher limit, open a support ticket*

> [!question]- What happens if we don't set reserved concurrency (limit)  per function?
> - If we don't set reserved concurrency per function then there is a chance that one of the functions eats up the *region limit of 1000 concurrent executions*. 
> - This means other functions won't be able to scale and will throttle.

### Concurrency and asynchronous invocations
- If the function *doesn't have enough concurrency* available to process all events, *additional requests are throttled*.
- For *throttling errors (429)* and *system errors (500-series)*, Lambda **returns the event to the queue** and **attempts to run the function again for up to 6 hours**.
- The **retry interval increases exponentially** from 1 second after the first attempt to a maximum of 5 minutes.

### Cold Starts & Provisioned Concurrency
- **Cold Start**:
	- *New instance* - *code is loaded* and *code outside the handler run (init)*
	- If the *init is large* (code, dependencies, SDK, etc) this process can take some time.
	- *First request served by new instances has higher latency* than the rest
- **Provisioned Concurrency**:
	- *Concurrency is allocated* before the function is invoked (*in advance*)
	- So the *cold start never happens* and all invocations have **low latency**
	- **Application Auto Scaling** can manage concurrency (*schedule* or *target utilisation*)

## Limits per region
- **Execution**:
	- *Memory* allocation: *128MB - 10GB* (1 MB increments)
	- Maximum *execution time*: 900 seconds (*15 minutes*)
	- *Environment variables (4 KB)*
	- *Disk capacity* in the "function container" (in `/tmp`): *512 MB*
	- *Concurrency executions: 1000* (can be increased)
- **Deployment**:
	- Lambda function deployment size (*compressed .zip*): *50 MB*
	- Size of *uncompressed deployment* (*code + dependencies*): *250 MB*
	- Can use the `/tmp` directory to load other files at startup
	- Size of *environment variables: 4 KB*

> [!note] If we have a *big file* then we should not use lambda. Limit of 512MB.
