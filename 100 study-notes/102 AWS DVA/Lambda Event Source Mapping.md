## Event Source Mapping
- Services:
	- **Kinesis Data Streams (KDS)**
	- **SQS & SQS FIFO queue**
	- **DynamoDB Streams**
		- `AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole` allows Lambda to read from dynamodb tables. 
- Records need to be **polled** from the source. This means lambda needs to ask the services for some records.
- Lambda is invoked **synchronously**.
- Internally an **event source map** is created which is responsible for polling kinesis and getting the results back.
- Once the event source map has data it will *invoke the lambda function synchronously for processing*.

> [!question]+ A company is setting up a Lambda function that will process events from a DynamoDB stream. The Lambda function has been created and a stream has been enabled. What else needs to be done for this solution to work?
> - An *event-source mapping* must be **created on the Lambda side** to associate the DynamoDB stream with the Lambda function.
> - The configuration of the event source mapping for stream-based services (DynamoDB, Kinesis), and Amazon SQS, is made on the **Lambda side**.

## Event Source Mappers
- There are two categories of event source mappers:
- Streams:  **Kinesis** & **DynamoDB streams**
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220523194948.png]]
- SQS & SQS FIFO
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220523200116.png]]

### Streams
#### Processing 
- An event source mapping creates an **iterator for each shard**, *processes items in order*
- Start with new items, from the beginning or from timestamp
- **Processed items aren't removed from the stream** (other consumers can read them)
- *Low traffic*: Use *batch window* to accumulate records before processing
- *High traffic*: You can *process multiple batches in parallel*
	- Up to *10 batches per shard*
	- *In-order processing* is still guaranteed for each partition key,
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220523195510.png]]

#### Error Handling
- By default, if your function returns an *error*, the **entire batch is reprocessed** until the function succeeds, or the items in the batch expire.
	- Can result in duplicate error logs even though kinesis guarantees deduplication.

> [!question]- A Developer is creating an AWS Lambda function to process a stream of data from an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream. When the *Lambda function parses the data and encounters a missing field, it exits the function with an error*. The function is generating duplicate records from the Kinesis stream. When the Developer looks at the stream output without the Lambda function, there are no duplicate records. What is the reason for the duplicates?
> With an *event source mapping* from a stream (Kinesis Data Stream), **Lambda retries the entire batch of items**. Therefore the Lambda function did not handle the error, and the Lambda service attempted to *reprocess the data*.

- To ensure in-order processing, processing for the **affected shard is paused** until the error is resolved
- You can configure the event source mapping to:
	- Discard old events
	- Restrict the number of retries
	- Split the batch on error (to work around Lambda timeout issues)
- Discarded events can go to a [[Lambda Destinations|destination]].

### SQS & SQS FIFO
#### Processing
- Event Source Mapping will poll SQS (**Long Polling**) 
- Specify *batch size*
- Recommended: Set the *queue visibility timeout to 6x the timeout of your Lambda function*
- To use a **DLQ**
	- *Set-up on the SQS queue*, not Lambda (*DLQ for Lambda is only for async invocations* and here we are dealing with synchronous invocations)
	- Or use a Lambda destination for failures

> [!note] For the lambda to read messages from the queue its execution role must have SQS permission.

## Queues & Lambda
- Lambda also *supports in-order processing for FIFO* (first-in, first-out) queues, scaling up to the number of active message groups.
- For standard queues, items aren't necessarily processed in order.
- Lambda *scales up to process a standard queue as quickly as possible*.
- When an error occurs, batches are returned to the queue as individual items and might be processed in a different grouping than the original batch.
- Occasionally, the event source mapping might receive the same item from the queue twice, even if no function error occurred.
- **Lambda deletes items from the queue after they're processed successfully**.
- You can configure the source queue to send items to a dead-letter queue if they can't be processed.

## Lambda Event Mapper Scaling
- *Kinesis Data Streams & DynamoDB Streams*:
	- **One Lambda invocation per stream shard**
	- If you use parallelisation, up to *10 batches processed per shard* simultaneously
- *SQS Standard*:
	- Lambda adds 60 more instances per minute to scale up
	- Up to 1000 batches of messages processed simultaneously
- *SQS FIFO*:
	- Messages with the same GroupID will be processed in order
	- The Lambda function scales to the number of active message groups
