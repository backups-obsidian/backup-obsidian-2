[[Introduction]]

## IAM
[[IAM Basics]]
[[STS & Identity Federation]]
[[Directory Services]]
[[Organisations]]
[[Miscellaneous]]

- **Random**
	- We can make calls to IAM using SDK or CLI but we can also make *direct calls to IAM web service* using the **Query API** (not recommended by AWS).
	- There shouldn't be an **explicit deny**.

## Containerisation
[[ECS]]
[[ECR & EKS]]

For *logging* in both EKC and ECS use **CloudWatch Container Insights** to *collect*, *aggregate*, and *summarise metrics* and logs from your containerised applications and micro services. 

## Serverless
In the beginning serverless just meant AWS Lambda but now it means anything thatâ€™s managed like databases, messaging, storage etc.
[[Lambda]]
[[API Gateway]]

- SAM (Serverless Application Model)
	- **Framework** for **developing**, **testing** and **deploying** serverless applications.
	- All the *configuration* is in **YAML**.
	- SAM can help us run Lambdas, DynamoDB, API Gateway etc **locally** in our system for **development**.
	- SAM can use **CodeDeploy to deploy Lambda functions**

## Encryption
[[KMS]]
[[SSM Parameter Store]]
[[Secrets Manager]]
[[CloudHSM]]

## Security
[[Shield, WAF & Firewall]]
[[GuardDuty]]
[[Inspector & Macie]]

## Monitoring and Auditing
[[CloudWatch]]
[[EventBridge]]
[[CloudTrail]]
[[Config]]

## VPC
[[VPC & Subnets]]
[[VPC Internet Access]]
[[DNS in VPC]]
[[NACLs]]
[[VPC Peering and Endpoints]]
[[VPC Flow Logs]]
[[Site to Site VPN]]
[[Direct Connect]]
[[AWS PrivateLink]]
[[Transit Gateway]]
[[IPv6 & Egress Internet Gateway]]
[[Networking Costs]]

- *Traffic mirroring* to capture and inspect network traffic packets in our VPC in a *non intrusive manner*.

## Disaster Recovery
[[Disaster Recovery]]
[[DMS]]
[[DataSync & Backup]]

## Other Services
[[Other Services]]
[[ElasticBeanstalk]]
[[HPC in AWS]]

## Miscellaneous
- Billing is a **global** service.
- **Unpredictable load** always go for **serverless** option.
- All the snapshots are stored in S3.
- *CloudFront* allows you to increase the performance and reduce the cost of the application *without making any application changes*.

- Different layers of caching
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220501161025.png]]

- Use *Golden AMI*, *EC2 User Data* and *ElasticBeanstalk* for instantiating applications quickly.
	- Create a *Golden AMI* with the *static installation components* already setup
	- Use *EC2 user data* to customise the *dynamic installation* parts at boot time


- Pillars of **well architected framework**.
	- *Operational Excellence*
	- *Security*
	- *Reliability*
	- *Performance Efficiency*
	- *Cost optimisation*

- **HA Bastion**: 
	- We will another create a bastion host in a new AZ for backup.
	- We can use a *NLB to route traffic* to the bastion hosts.
	- We **cannot use ALB** since it works for HTTP level traffic and for SSH we need TCP level traffic.
