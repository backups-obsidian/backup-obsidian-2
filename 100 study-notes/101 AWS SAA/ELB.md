## Introduction
- **Managed** load balancer by AWS.
- **Serve multiple AZs in the same region**. For multi region load balancing we need [[Route53]].
- ELBs handle failures of EC2 instances by not sending them traffic and **provides regular health check of EC2 instances**.
	- The health check is done *on a port and a route*. For example:
		- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220420150839.png]]
	- If the response is *not 200* then the *instance is unhealthy* and *no traffic will be sent to it*.
	
- ELBs provide **SSL termination**.
- Separates public traffic from private traffic.
- Load balancer security group will receive traffic from anywhere. This security group will be used as an inbound rule by the EC2 instances. [[EC2 Basics#^52df0e|Security group referencing]].
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220420151342.png]] 
	- We use port 80 for EC2 instances since TLS termination happens at load balancer.

## Logging
- **Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer**.
-  Each log contains information such as the time the request was received, the client's IP address, latencies, request paths, and server responses. You can use these access logs to **analyse traffic patterns** and **troubleshoot issues**.
-   Access logging is an optional feature of Elastic Load Balancing that is **disabled by default**.
-   After you enable access logging for your load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing **captures the logs and stores them in the Amazon S3 bucket** that you specify as **compressed files**. You can disable access logging at any time.

## SSL/TLS
- Traffic is encrypted between the client and the load balancer.
- **TLS** is the **newer** version of SSL. To remember T > S. 
- The load balancer performs SSL termination. We *use HTTP inside our private VPC*.
- The load balancer **uses** **X.509** certificate.
- We **manage** the **certificates** using **AWS Certificate Manager** (ACM).

## SNI
- **Server name indication**.
- It solves the critical problem of **loading multiple SSL certs onto one web server**.
	- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220420161151.png]]
- Supported by *ALB* and *NLB*. Not supported by CLB. For SNI in CLB we have to use CloudFront distribution.
- In order to use SNI, all you need to do is *bind multiple certificates to the same secure listener on your load balancer*. ALB will *automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate* for each client.
- Wildcard certificates can only handle sub domains and not domains.
