## Strongly consistent
- All S3 *GET, PUT, and LIST* operations, as well as operations that change object tags, ACLs, or metadata, are *strongly consistent*. **What you write is what you will read**, and the results of a LIST will be an accurate reflection of what’s in the bucket.
- For example:  A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3 always returns the latest version of the object.

## Scaling Requests
- Your application can achieve **at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE** and **5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket**.
- There is *no limit to the number of prefixes in a bucket*. Which means you can scale the requests infinitely.
	- If you create *10 prefixes* in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelise reads, you could scale your read performance to *55,000 read requests* per second.
	- Different prefixes

> [!question]- Customer requests are failing during peak hours since there are more than 5000 requests per second. How do you solve it?
> Change the application architecture to *create customer-specific custom prefixes* within the single bucket and then upload the daily files into those prefixed locations.

- Although you can increase the number of prefixes there is a chance that *SSE KMS can limit the performance* of S3 because of its limits depending on the region.
	- There is a KMS quota of number of requests per second per region
	- We would have to request a quota increase.

## Multi part
-   It is **recommend** to use multi part download for files **over 100mb**. **Mandatory** for files over **5Gb**
-   **Multipart downloads happen in parallel** there by increasing the speed.

## Transfer Acceleration
- **Increase transfer speed** by *sending the file to AWS edge location* and then sending the file to S3 bucket in the target region.
- It *supports multi part download/upload*.
- We **minimise** the **public internet** and **maximise** the **private AWS network** we go through.

- For Transfer Acceleration (S3TA), you pay only for transfers that are accelerated. If the acceleration fails you don’t pay for it.

> [!note] Transfer acceleration is the only case where you *pay for data going* into S3.

> [!tip] Go for transfer acceleration if you come across key words like *fast data transfer irrespective of user location*.

> [!important]+ When to choose Transfer Acceleration over CloudFront
> If you have objects that are *smaller than 1GB* or if the data set is less than 1GB in size, you should consider using Amazon CloudFront's PUT/POST commands for optimal performance. If the use case has *data larger than 1GB* then Transfer Acceleration is the better option.

## Byte Range Fetches
- **Parallelising get requests** by requesting specific byte ranges.
- Can be used to speed up downloads
- Can be used to *retrieve only partial data* (for example the head of a file)

> [!note]- You can use *concurrent connections* to Amazon S3 to fetch different byte ranges from within the same object. **No need to go through object one by one**.
> This means *Create an application that will traverse the S3 bucket, issue a Byte Range Fetch for the first 250 bytes, and store that information in RDS* over *Create an application that will traverse the S3 bucket, read all the files one by one, extract the first 250 bytes, and store that information in RDS*
