## Error status codes
- *4xx* is *client side* errors where as *5xx* is *server side* errors.
- *HTTP 400* - Bad request
- *HTTP 401* - **Unauthorised**
- *HTTP 403* - **Forbidden error**: *WAF* 
- *HTTP 500* - **Internal server error**: *network connectivity*.
- *HTTP 501* - Not implemented: *header with and unsupported value*.
- *HTTP 502* - Bad gateway: *TCP connection was closed*.
- **HTTP 503** - **Service unavailable**: 
	- *Target groups* have **no registered targets**
- *HTTP 504* - Gateway timeout:  

## Monitoring
- All Load Balancer metrics are directly pushed to CloudWatch metrics.
- Metrics sent:
	- BackendConnectionErrors
	- *HealthyHostCount/UnHealthyHostCount*
	- HTTPCode Backend 2XX: Successful request
	- HTTPCode_Backend_3XX, redirected request
	- *HTTPCode_ELB_4XX*: *Client* error codes
	- *HTTPCode_ELB_5XX*: *Server*, error codes generated by the load balancer.
	- **RequestCountPerTarget**: Good metric to monitor and *scale on*
	- **SurgeQueueLength**: The total number of requests (HTTP listener) or connections (TCP listener) that are pending routing to a healthy instance. **Help to scale out ASG**. 
		- Max value is 1024
		- We don't want to have a big queue of requests
	- **SpilloverCount**: The total number of *requests that were rejected* because the surge queue is full.
		- This is something we never want over 0, if it is over 0 then we need to scale our backend.

## Troubleshooting
- *HTTP 400: BAD_REQUEST*: The client sent a *malformed request* that does not meet HTTP specifications.
- **HTTP 503: Service Unavailable**: *Ensure that you have healthy instances* in *every Availability Zone* that your load balancer is configured to respond in.
	- Look for *HealthyHostCount* in CloudWatch
- **HTTP 504: Gateway Timeout**: Check if *keep-alive settings on your EC2 instances are enabled* and make sure that the **keep-alive timeout is greater than the idle timeout settings of load balancer**.

- **Request tracing** - Each HTTP request has an added custom header `X-Amzn-Trace-Id`
	- Example: `X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=1-67891233-abcdef012345678912345678`
- This is useful in logs / *distributed tracing platform* to track a single request

## Logging
- **Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer**.
-  Each log contains information such as the time the request was received, the client's IP address, latencies, request paths, and server responses. You can use these access logs to **analyse traffic patterns** and **troubleshoot issues**.
-   Access logging is an optional feature of Elastic Load Balancing that is **disabled by default**.
-   After you enable access logging for your load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing **captures the logs and stores them in the Amazon S3 bucket** that you specify as **compressed files**. You can disable access logging at any time.
- We *only pay for S3 storage*.
- Helpful for **compliance reasons**.
