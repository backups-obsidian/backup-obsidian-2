- Using `pickle` vs saving objects in `json` format
	- [WTF Is "Pickle" In Python?! (EXTREMELY Useful!) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q56r_fVqgw)
	- The video discusses the concept of pickling in Python, which refers to the process of serialising an object so that it can be saved and later retrieved. 
	- The video also compares pickling to using a JSON file or a text file for saving data, and demonstrates how pickling can be used to save an instance of a class with attributes.
