## Naming Conventions
- **Camel Case**: `myVariableName`
	- Used in Java, JavaScript and other programming languages

- **Snake Case**: `my_variable_name` or `my_function_name`
	- Used in python to *name variables and functions*.
- **Pascal Case**: `MyClassName`
	- Also known as Capital Camel Case
	- Used to *name classes* in python.
- **Kebab Case**: `some-package-name`
	- Also known as Lisp case or caterpillar case
	- Generally you will see this kind of naming convention while installing packages using pip. 
		- `pip install opencv-python` or `pip install scikit-learn`
	- We install packages in Kebab case but import them using snake case
