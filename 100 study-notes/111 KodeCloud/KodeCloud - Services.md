## Services
- **Services in linux help us configure software that run in the background**.
	- Services make sure that the software runs all the time automatically when the servers are rebooted and follow the right order of startup.
	- *Web server or database server are example of services*.

- When we install a web server or docker they are automatically configured as services.
- Starting the services
	- `sudo systemctl start <service-name>`
	- `sudo service <service-name> start`
