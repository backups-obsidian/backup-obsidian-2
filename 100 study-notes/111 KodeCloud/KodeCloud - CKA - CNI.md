## CNI (Container Networking Interface)
- CNI is a set of standards that define how programs should be developed to solve networking challenges in a container runtime environment.
- The programs are plugins for CNI.
- CNI defines how the plugins should be developed and how the container runtimes should invoke them.

> [!note] Docker DOES NOT follow CNI it has its own standard known as CNM (Container Network Model).
