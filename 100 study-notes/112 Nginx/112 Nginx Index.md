## Try out / Experiment
- [ ] Set proper access logs format from the nginx video and check if its working or not.
- [ ] Run a frontend container. Just expose port 80. Don't expose port 3000. Now try accessing it. It should work.
- [ ] Now use path like /dashboard in NGINX and see if everything is working fine.
- [ ] Add headers to see if the headers are returned in response.
- [ ] Check access logs when you do the above experiments.
- [ ] Try out side car proxy with strip_path = False
