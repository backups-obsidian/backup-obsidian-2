## Idea
- Check for notes reminder. 
- It should be a service which sends you a note **from your notetaking application of choice** to your *email daily*. 
- This might help in better retention of topics. 
- *Build it modular so that it is easy to add different note taking applications*. 
- They *should be independent of the display format and mail sending*. 
- Have *option for storing what note was sent so that it isn't sent again* within a fixed time.
- This can lead to tip of the day linkedin service.
