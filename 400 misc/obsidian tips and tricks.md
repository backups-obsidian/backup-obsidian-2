- If you hover  over a note or link and then press CMD in mac you can preview it. Example [[400 misc/note taking in obsidian]] place your cursor over this link. Don't do `CMD + Click`, it will open the note.
- To delete a file you can use the command palette. 
- We can use HTML style toggle blocks using the following syntax

<details> <summary>Try to avoid this</summary> 
These are toggle blocks without heading.
# We cannot have heading
</details>

- **Folding images**

- Normal text doesn't get encapsulated whereas in headings they would.
- The easiest way to use it is by using the source mode instead of preview mode. Just make sure they are indented. 
- There is an annoying dot on the left side of the image but I feel its manageable

Normal text
- Use workspaces if you want saved states
